        "# Extending Caravan to new basins\n",
        "\n",
        "Author: Frederik Kratzert\n",
        "Contact: kratzert@google.com\n",
        "\n",
        "Last updated: Jan 16, 2025\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is part of the [Caravan publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01975-w) and is the first of two notebooks that can be used to extend the dataset to new basins. This notebook is intended to be run on Google Colab so that the data exports to Earth Engine works as intended.\n",
        "\n",
        "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/kratzert/Caravan/blob/main/code/Caravan_part1_Earth_Engine.ipynb)\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is Caravan?\n",
        "\n",
        "Caravan is ...\n",
        "- an open source, large-sample rainfall-runoff dataset.\n",
        "- derived entirely in the cloud (Earth Engine).\n",
        "- a dataset that only uses globally available data products (namely [ECMWF's ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview) and [HydroATLAS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydroatlas) by Linke et al.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "- to democratize large-sample hydrology: Anyone can extend the dataset to new regions without downloading and preprocessing large amounts of raw data. Instead, we use freely available cloud resources to do all heavy lifting in the cloud and only download the processed results.\n",
        "- to advance research on global rainfall-runoff models: So far, we have seen  different large-sample datasets (e.g. CAMELS variants) that are specific to individual countries. However, due to the use of data products with only local coverage (e.g. meteorological forcing data or static attribute maps), intercomparisons betweens these products are not straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- You need a Google account to be able to use Earth Engine\n",
        "- You need to add your shapefile as an [Asset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/table_upload#upload-a-shapefile) to Google Earth Engine\n",
        "- The shapefile needs to have one field that indicates the basin/gauge ID, which will be used to link the derived data to the individual basin. Make sure to adapt the corresponding variable in the \"General configuration\" section below. It is recommend to name this field `gauge_id`, which will safe you some adaptations across the 2nd notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: This notebook only derives catchment attributes and meteorological forcing data for each polygon in the shapefile layer. We do not provide additional streamflow data beyond what is already included in Caravan.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Making new data available to the community\n",
        "\n",
        "We envision Caravan as a dynamically growing dataset that can be extended by its users. While making a large-sample dataset available upon the intial publication, the distribution of the basins is still limited to a few regions in the world. Ideally, this will change over time. Anyone who uses Caravan and this code to extend the dataset is invited to also share the streamflow time series data with the community, even if it is just for a single (or a few) basins. By doing so, little by little, we could create a new, globally spanning open source dataset that anyone can use for their own work/research. For the moment, the [discussion forum](https://github.com/kratzert/caravan/discussions) on the Github repository is the place to share information on data that you want to contribute. See also the [wiki](https://github.com/kratzert/caravan/wiki) on Github for further information.\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Structure of this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "The code consists of two different sections:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. To derive static catchment attributes from HydroATLAS.\n",
        "2. To spatially aggregate ERA5-Land forcing data for each polygon.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the first point takes a couple of seconds up to a few minutes, depending on the number of basins, the second point takes considerably longer. However, within this notebook we only start jobs to process ERA5-Land on Earth Engine and to store the data in Google Drive. The tasks will run in the background and this notebook can be closed after the end of this notebook is reached. For details, see the introduction in each of the two data processing sections.\n",

        "\n",
        "- `ASSET_NAME`: String defining the path of the asset in Google Earth Engine. Usually something like `projects/ee-{username}/assets/{asset_name}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME`: The name of the folder (in Google Drive) that is used to store the resulting data. For example, `OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME = 'my_caravan_extension'` will create a folder called `my_caravan_extension` in the main directory of your Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `BASIN_ID_FIELD`: Name of the attribute field in the shapefile that contains the basin id. It is recommended to name this field `gauge_id`. Make sure that this name does not conflict with any of the field names of HydroATLAS. For example, you could use something like `'gauge_id'` or `'basin_id'` but _not_ `'HYBAS_ID'`, `'PFAF_ID'`, or `'MAIN_BAS'`, which are all existing field names in HydroATLAS/HydroSHEDS.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `BASIN_PREFIX`: A short descriptive string that is prepended to each basin id and that should be unique within the Caravan data space. For example, we use `camels` for basins from the CAMELS (US) dataset and `camelsgb` from the CAMELS-GB dataset. The final name for each basin within the attribute table will be `{BASIN_PREFIX}_{GAUGE_ID}`. Note, if you already included such a prefix in the basin id field of your shapefile, leave this field as an empty string. Please also read the README in the Caravan dataset folder on details about the folder structure of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `AREA_MAX_THRESHOLD` (in km2): Defines the upper bound for the basin area. Larger basins in the shapefile are ignored when deriving the attributes and forcings. If `None`, all basins are considered. Note: To avoid user quota errors when processing too large basins, HydroATLAS attributes are derived from different HydroATLAS levels, given the size of a catchment. See [Configuration for HydroATLAS](#configuration-for-hydroatlas).\n",
        "\n",
        "- `AREA_MIN_THRESHOLD` (in km2): Defines the lower bound for the basin area. Smaller basins in the shapefile are ignored when deriving the attributes and forcings. If `None`, all basins are considered. Note: Due to the underlying resolution of HydroATLAS the attributes for basins that are much smaller than the HydroATLAS subpolygons will potentially become less and less representative of your catchment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `EE_PROJECT_NAME`: Name of your personal Earth Engine project. Usually some string starting like `ee-{username}` if you followed the default project creation. Required to access your uploaded assets."

The time depends on the length of ERA5-Land data that you request, the number of basins in your shape layer, the size of the basins and on the numbers of points that span your polygons. If your basin polygons have a very fine resolution, consider simplifying them to speed up this step, e.g., using the [QGIS simplify function](https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vector_geometry_tools/simplifygeometries.html) (we used the default tolerance of 1.0 for e.g. CAMELS US and CAMELS CL)\n",

By using hourly data, we can shift the forcing data to local time before we compute the daily aggregates and thus make sure that the forcing data aligns with the underlying streamflow data. However, this is part of the second processing step of the meteorological forcing data that runs on your local machine (no worries, this is something that any laptop/PC can do), after we used Earth Engine to compute the spatial averages.\n",

The data are the spatially averaged ERA5-Land variables that we request Earth Engine to process. Note: These files can become large since this is still a lot of data. If you do not have enough free space in your Google Drive, either upgrade your disk space or process the ERA5-Land time period in chunks and download the processed data after every step.\n",

That is, if your basins are east of UTC-0, adapt your `START_DATE` to include e.g. the 31st December. If the basins are west of UTC-0, adapt the `END_DATE` to include 1st January. If you want to be on the safe side, simply include a 1 day buffer on both side and then crop the data in the 2nd notebook."
