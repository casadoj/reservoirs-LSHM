    "This notebook reads all the attributes and time series in the dataset and selects the reservoirs appropriate for testing the different reservoir routines. Several conditions need to be met for a reservoir to be selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must contain observed time series of the variables `inflow`, `storage` and `outflow`.\n",
    "2. The longest period without gaps in those three time series needs to be longer than 4 years.\n",
    "3. The bias between the observed inflow and outflow timeseries needs to be between 0.7 and 1.3.\n",
